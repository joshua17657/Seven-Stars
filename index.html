        <strong>The Seven Stars Inn</strong> is the original Chester County steakhouse, 
            featuring overly generous portions of the finest beef, 
            veal and seafood served in a gracious white table cloth atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cocktail lounge is warm and inviting, and the well thought out wine 
            list includes a broad spectrum of varietals and geographic origins.
        </p>
        <p>
            Family friendly, the Seven Stars has a great Young Adults Menu that scales
            down the size of their serving and price of their offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dinner only is served at the Seven Stars and the inn is closed on Mondays. 
            Credit cards are accepted and reservations are suggested.
